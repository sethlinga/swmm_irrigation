# **Optimizing irrigation gate operations using evolutionary algorithms: Talibon SRIS case study**

This is the project repository of the paper, whose abstract is the following:

Inefficient irrigation management leads to suboptimal water distribution, exacerbating inequities between upstream and downstream users and constrains agricultural productivity. We address this challenge by developing an optimization model to improve gate operations in the Talibon small reservoir irrigation system, Philippines. Using the Storm Water Management Model (SWMM), we simulate the hydrodynamics along the main canal and integrate it with SWMM5-EA, an evolutionary algorithm-based optimization tool, to determine optimal opening and closing of gates for equitable water allocation. The modeled traditional operation yielded excessive upstream withdrawals and downstream deficits. After optimizing the gate hours, the new operation reduced overall irrigation deficits by 89.7\%, conserving about 1.95 million cubic meters of water by preventing over-irrigation. This study offers practitioners a scalable decision-support tool to balance equity and efficiency and determine the ideal operational management in the infrastructural modernization of irrigation systems.
